Set up a starter repo to help learn about and/or bootstrap your tamagui app:

### Templates

There are four starter templates:

- Free - Expo, Expo Router, Solito and Next.js (with both `/pages` and `/app`
  dir).
- Learn - Client-only web app with Webpack or Vite. Useful to understand how to
  set up tamagui.config.ts.
- [Expo Router](/docs/guides/expo) - The Expo Router default starter with
  Tamagui added via `@tamagui/metro-plugin`.
- [Takeout](/takeout) - A more robust, paid and supported starter kit.

### Usage

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

Check out
[the source of the templates](https://github.com/tamagui/starter-free).

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for
creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your
views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo we borrowed from.

### Starting out

The starter-free app requires yarn to run.

To run the app:

```bash
cd myapp
yarn
yarn web # Web local dev
yarn native # Expo local dev (only for `starter-free`)
```

## üì¶ Included packages (`starter-free`)

- `tamagui` for cross-platform views, themes and animations
- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `expo-router` for having same routing concepts between web and native
- Expo SDK 48
- Next.js 13

By integrating `Tamagui`, `expo-router`, `Solito`, and, `Next.js` you can enjoy
the power and simplicity of creating universal apps.

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` only for starter-free template, contains the navigation code
      for RN

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing
and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev: `yarn native`
  - Runs `expo start`

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across
platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```bash
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in
`apps/expo`:

```bash
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to
get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to
be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the
versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a
classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't
need to use Lerna to use that lib).
