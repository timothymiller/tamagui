### Error 001

Haven't called createTamagui yet.

This often happens due to having duplicate Tamagui sub-dependencies.

Tamagui needs every `@tamagui/*` dependency to be on the exact same version, we include an upgrade script
with the starter kits that you can call with "yarn upgrade:tamagui" to help with this.

Be sure to remove "react-native-web-lite" as it has been deprecated and can cause this too.

You may want to clear your node_modules as well and run a fresh install after ugprading.

### Warning 001

#### Ignorable modules

This error means the compiler can't bundle some dependencies into what it reads
at compile-time in order to optimize. It's not necessarily an error and usually
won't de-opt.

To see a full stack trace set:

```bash
DEBUG=tamagui
```

To disable the warning you can set:

```bash
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=some_module_name,some_other_module_name
# Or to disable them all (not recommended):
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=true
```

### Warning 002

You're rendering a Tamagui <Adapt /> component without nesting it inside a parent that is able to adapt.
