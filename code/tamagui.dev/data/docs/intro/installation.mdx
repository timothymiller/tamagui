description: Get Tamagui set up, step by step
---

<IntroParagraph>
We recommend using `npm create tamagui@latest` to bootstrap one of our starter templates, with examples for many frameworks.
</IntroParagraph>

The base Tamagui style library, `@tamagui/core`, has only one dependency: React. It's lighter weight than React Native Web, yet gives you a much broader style API.

Install it with:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

If you plan to use the full UI kit, `tamagui`, you can avoid installing `@tamagui/core` altogether. Instead:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

The `tamagui` package is a superset of core, so anywhere in the docs `@tamagui/core` is used, you can replace it with `tamagui`.

Add the optional `TamaguiProvider` to customize your design system and settings:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider, View } from '@tamagui/core'
import config from './tamagui.config' // your configuration

export default function App() {
  return (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
    <View width={200} height={200} backgroundColor="$background" />
  </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/core/configuration) docs for a comprehensive overview of what can be in your config. 

If you'd like to get started more quickly with presets, we have `@tamagui/config`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

You can use it like so:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider, createTamagui } from '@tamagui/core'
import { defaultConfig } from '@tamagui/config/v4'

// you usually export this from a tamagui.config.ts file
const config = createTamagui(defaultConfig)

type Conf = typeof config

// get nice types
declare module '@tamagui/core' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default () => {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

You are ready to go.

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button theme="blue">Hello world</Button>
}
```

From here, we'd recommend [spending some time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration). Tamagui works across 100% of it's features at runtime and compile-time. This means you can wait until you absolutely need more performance to [set up the compiler](/docs/intro/compiler-install).

## Guides

Tamagui generally doesn't require any special bundler setup as we've worked hard to make it "just work" without configuration in a wide variety of environments.

That said, the broader React Native and React Native Web ecosystem is filled with packages that do need configuration. Tamagui provides a variety of bundler plugins that help improve that compatibility, as well as letting you opt into the optimizing compiler.
