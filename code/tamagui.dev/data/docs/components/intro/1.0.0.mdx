# Tamagui UI

<Description>
  Fully open source compound components on all&nbsp;React&nbsp;platforms, styled or unstyled.
</Description>

Tamagui UI is an open source collection of "[compound components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/compound-components-react/)" that all work on both on web and React Native. Some components render the same on all platforms, but many now [Adapt](/ui/popover) to render as different components depending on platform or capability. A few components have `native` adaptations where they can render to platform-native output. For example, Sheet, which can optionally on iOS render into a native UIKit Sheet.

All components in the kit can be installed independently, or you can install them all at once with:

```bash
yarn add tamagui @tamagui/config
```

## Setup

The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`, so if you've already installed core you can change all the references to `tamagui`.

You'll need to add a provider to the root of your app (unlike core, where that is optional), as it will set up the root portal for components like dialogs and popovers.

```tsx
import { createTamagui,TamaguiProvider, View } from 'tamagui'
import defaultConfig from '@tamagui/config/v3'

const config = createTamagui(defaultConfig)

export default () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
    <View />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

For a full guide configuration with `createTamagui`, check [the core configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration).
