<IntroParagraph>
  It's been nearly two full years since version one. What happened?
</IntroParagraph>

Tamagui is a cross-platform styling library and UI kit for React with a simple but effective optimizing compiler that helps it achieve a near zero-runtime performance while outputting platform-optimized code (div and CSS on web, hoisted objects on native). Every feature works at both runtime and compile-time, and on both native and web, and it let you achieve either consistent UI across platforms, or render to platform-specific UI elements with `<Adapt />` and the `native` prop.

Version 2 has been long overdue. We launched two full-on products in the last year, and Tamagui has always been
a side project of mine for the last few years, though it's been helped along by a great team of developers thanks to sponsors and our products.

Version 2 only makes a few breaking changes:

- `tamagui` becomes `@tamagui/ui`
- `@tamagui/cli` is now just `tamagui`, so you can `npx tamagui` to use the CLI (for creating starters, linting, one-off compiling, and a doctor command).
- Accessibility props - 
- Flex defaults - 
- TypeScript 5 -
- Button - Button moves to a compound component only API (with the old button available still as `OldButton`)
- ListItem - ListItem moves to a compound component only API
- Select - Select inherits from ListItem, so it just inherits the same changes.

A ton has changed since version 1, we've collected all the major changes below.

---

## @tamagui/core

The core styling library now has no dependency at all outside of React. It's a self-contained 30Kb universal styling library. It implements the React Native View, Text and styling APIs (which are basically a subset of CSS, in Typescript), and expands them to include a lot more of what CSS can do. It feels in practice much like a typed Stitches or Styled Components.

Here are some highlights since version 1:

#### Aligning

#### Container Queries

#### useProps, useStyle, usePropsAndStyle

####

## @tamagui/ui

## Acknowledgements

We've had 38 new contributors since early this year, exponentially increasing! Thanks to all of them, and also to the many QA testers that join in our Discord chat every day :).

Early sponsors have made a huge difference: I owe a large thank you to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Codingscape](https://codingscape.com), [QuestPortal](https://www.questportal.com) and [BeatGig](https://beatgig.com), the first corporate sponsors ❤️.

Tamagui draws inspiration and small areas of code from some incredible other libraries: [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) provided much of the compound component APIs, [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) handles all of the floating elements positioning, [Moti](https://moti.fyi) which served as a start point for the animation drivers, and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the nifty AnimatePresence functionality.
