This Policy also explains your choices regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. Please note that this Policy does not apply to companies or individuals outside of our ownership or control.

## Collection of Information

We collect any information you provide when making a purchase through the Website. Currently, this includes your email address, which is necessary for logging into the Website and accessing purchased Tamagui UI products.

## Purchases

All purchases through the Website are processed by a third-party payment processor, Stripe (stripe.com). Stripe may request personal and/or non-personal information such as your name, address, email address, or credit card information. Stripe's privacy policy (stripe.com/legal-buyers/) governs its collection and use of information. We do not control Stripe's practices. For questions or concerns about Stripeâ€™s practices, please contact Stripe directly.

## Managing Information

You can update your Personal Information in your "Account Settings" on the Website, currently limited to your email address. You may also request deletion of your email address, though this will revoke access to purchased products.

We may retain unrevised information in our records, and some information may remain in our private records after deletion for a retention period. After this period, Personal Information is deleted, but we may retain and use information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.

## Use of Information
