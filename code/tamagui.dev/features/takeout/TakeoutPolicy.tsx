        Tamagui LLC will deliver to you access to a GitHub repository that contains the

        apps using Tamagui on React Native, supporting the most recent two versions of iOS
        and Android, as well as building and shipping websites that support Chrome,
        Safari, and Firefox versions released within the last two years. You also get
        access to a CLI which can install fonts from Google Fonts, and icons from
        icones.js.org.
